            <h1>Services</h1>

            <p>
 All pups of 10 weeks or older are welcome to a Free evaluation to sort you and your baby to the right starting point.
            </p>

               <h3 class="serviceheaders"> Basic Training:</h3>

               <p class="servicepara">
 Leash walking, basic manners, beginner commands; (sit, down, focus, wait, leave it, drop it, emergency recall). We will also work on beginning socialization. I will give tips on potty training throughout this course.
            </p>
                <h3 class="serviceheaders">Intermediate training:</h3>

                <p>
 Furthering basic skills and commands, walking in a heel, staying, getting used to distractions, and becoming more confident with your pup accepting a friendly stranger. Also can work on getting your pup to go to its bed/crate (at the owner's request).
            </p>

                <h3 class="serviceheaders">Advanced Training:</h3> 

                <p>
 Working in the real world with all prior skills and commands, out-of-sight stay, taking your pups out in public, and walking them through a crowd while being comfortable and confident. I also offer Supervised separation training in this class (It consists of leaving your dog with someone you trust and walking away while your dog is still maintaining good manners).
            </p>

                <h3 class="serviceheaders">Private Training:</h3>

                <p>
 Helping address your issues with your pup and work in a more one on one environment with you and them. (If your dog shows any signs of aggression, this is the best class training to start them out with.)
            </p>

               <h3 class="serviceheaders">Therapy Preparation:</h3>

               <p>
 We will work on your dog getting used to putting their head in our laps, receiving "clumsy petting,"  being petted by a crowd, putting their paws up on a bed, receiving a hug, and learning our dogs' comfort levels. 
(For this class, your dog must have completed all training courses or have been evaluated to this level. Taking this class does not automatically make your dog Therapy certified. It is just preparing them to further them for future Therapy training and evaluations.)
